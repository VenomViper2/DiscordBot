Much of their diet is made up of hardy root vegetables, supplemented with meats hunted from the surrounding areas.\n\n The beastâ€™s corpses are not wasted, their hides being used for clothing, leather for drums, and bones for jewellery and dice.\n
            Those in the bogs build rock brick houses atop piles of carefully stacked flat stones, plugging the gaps with reeds and mud.\n\n Small tufts of fluff picked from those reeds are also spun into fibres and weaved into soft clothing. Their diets are mostly made of odd fruits, and squashes, with fish as a rare treat. The travel enabled by rafts also allows them to trade culture and foods with the Crags and the Shimmersands, though the Ore Piles are more difficult to reach.
