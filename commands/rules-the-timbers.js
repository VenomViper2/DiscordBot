            Cabins in the timbers are mostly built of huge wooden logs. Some have chimneys built of stone, though due to the scarcity of the necessary materials, and difficulty of building, this is usually reserved for the larger buildings.\n\nMuch of the Timberâ€™s clothing is made with ferns, with hides and furs being rarer than in much of the rest of the world.`,
